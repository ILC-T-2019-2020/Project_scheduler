# ILC_T 2019-2020 Project Schedule Optimizer

Based on the problem description, we have provided a testing script that calculates the score for you.

The format of your solution file should be as follows:

1) a csv file 
2) each line is a pairing 'i,j,m', where i and j are indexes of the students and m is the time they should meet
3) i, j and m should be separated by a single colon 

Running test script:
```
python tests.py  --dataset_path='./ilct_studentdata.csv' --sol_path='./test_sol.csv' --alpha=20 --beta=5 ----lefterover_penalty=50
```

Turn Debug option on to see why your solution generates this result.

Commit your code & results (in csv file) to the submissions folder so we could all see your progress!
